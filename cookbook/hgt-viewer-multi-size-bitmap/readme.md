HGT Viewer Read Me
===

### Live Demo

[HGT Viewer (latest)]( http://jaanga.github.io/terrain-plus/cookbook/hgt-viewer/latest/ )

## Concept

### Mission
Provide a web browser viewer for HGT and SRTM files - binary data containers of elevation data. 
Translates data on the fly and displays in your browser

### Vision
Help make it easier and faster to visualize mashed-up elevation data from a variety of sources


## Features
* Reads the binary data in an HGT or SRTM file and displays it as a colored image
* Converts 'big endian' data to 'little endian' data
* Displays HGT files in ['Data-Samples folder']( https://github.com/jaanga/terrain-plus/tree/gh-pages/data-samples/ )
	* Samples include 30 Second data from Scripps Institute/UCSD, 3 Second data from de Ferranti and 1 Second data from the USGS
* Elevation, X & Y, RGB, minimum and maximum elevations and other data are displayed as you move your cursor over the image
	* Verifies that data goes from file to image to data correctly
* Select to view in 'raw' or 'pretty' or 'mistake' colors
	* Pretty colors are generated by algorithm
	* The algorithm sets a color range algorithm that can cope with plus or minus 11K elevations
	* Mistake colors are simply BGR instead of RGB - but are much more readable by the human eye
* Checks the file for exceptions - data lower than the Marianas Trench or higher than Mount Everest
* Provides ability to save the data as a PNG bitmap


## Road Map
* Provide a color look up table until a nice color algorithm is worked out
* Have all the features of [PNG Viewer]( http://jaanga.github.io/terrain-viewer/png-viewer/readme-reader.html )
* Permalinks
* Capability to differentiate distinctly color ranges above and below zero

## Issues /Bugs
* Elevation colors in 'pretty' mode are not pretty enough

## Project Links

You have two ways of viewing the HGT Viewer files:

* Web page hosted on GitHub: [jaanga.github.io]( http://jaanga.github.io/terrain-plus/cookbook/hgt-viewer/ "view the files as apps." ) <input value="<< You are now probably here." size=28 style="font:bold 12pt monospace;border-width:0;" >  
* Source code on GitHub: [github.com/jaanga]( https://github.com/jaanga/terrain-plus/tree/gh-pages/cookbook/hgt-viewer/ "View the files as source code." ) <scan style=display:none ><< You are now probably here.</scan>

This project is a continuation of [Read HGT Files]( http://jaanga.github.io/terrain-plus/cookbook/read-hgt-files/readme-reader.html )
