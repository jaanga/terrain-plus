### Shaded Releif / CleanTOP2

Nice bit too low res

> CleanTOPO2 comes in three versions tailored to meet different design and production needs. 
> All versions are 16-bit grayscale TIF files measuring 10,800 x 5,400-pixels and include a World (.tfw) file 
> and "Read me" document with projection and datum information. 
> The Geographic projection is used. All data available here are in the public domain.

— a global 30 arc-second grid of global elevations; it is a continuous terrain model for ocean and land.
- 1.8 GB unzipped. Data is in netCDF format. Don't know how to read this yet


> Released: September 2010 
> — generated by combining quality-controlled ship depth soundings with interpolation between sounding points guided by satellite derived gravity data.
> A ‘source identifier’, SID, grid is also available to download to accompany the GEBCO_08 Grid. 
> This shows which grid cells have been constrained by bathymetry data during the gridding process.
 
From PDF:
> Within the netCDF files for the GEBCO_08 Grid and GEBCO_08 SID Grid, the data are stored as one-dimensional arrays of 2-byte signed integer values.  
> The complete data sets give global coverage and each file consists of 21,600 rows x 43,200 columns, resulting in 933,120,000 data points. The data start at the Northwest corner of the files, i.e. for the global files, position 89° 59’ 45’’N, 179° 59’ 45’’W and are arranged in latitudinal bands of 360 degrees x 120 points/degree = 43,200 values. The data range eastward from 179° 59’ 45’’W to 179° 59’ 45’’E. Thus, the first band contains 43,200 values for 89° 59’ 45’’N, then followed by a band of 43,200 values at 89°59’ 15’’N and so on at 30 arc-second latitude intervals down to 89° 59’ 45’’S.  
> The data values are pixel centre registered i.e. they refer to data values at the centre of grid cells.

2014-03-27 ~ Looks like a good data set to use as the base

Update 2013-12
SRTM 30 second ~1km ~120/degree 
Data are in SRTM format - most likely could read with HGT viewer 



Also: ftp://topex.ucsd.edu/pub/global_topo_1min/ << has img files

> The pixel-registered data are stored in 33 files with names corresponding to the upper left corner of the array shown below. 
> The data are also merged into a single large (1.9 Gbyte, 2-byte integer) file as well as smaller 1-minute and 2-minute netcdf versions.
> Matching files of source identification number are available for determining the data source for every pixel.
